      <h2>What is Veritas?</h2>
      <p>Veritas is an advanced AI-powered legal strategy and document generation assistant developed by AI Law Solutions. It helps users analyze legal situations, draft motions, generate citations, and receive intelligent strategy suggestions based on context and input.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Do I need a lawyer if I use Veritas?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Veritas is not a substitute for a licensed attorney. It is a legal assistant tool meant to enhance your productivity and insight — not to provide legal advice or representation. Always consult a qualified attorney for official legal matters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can Veritas draft real court documents?</h2>
      <p>Yes — Veritas can generate legally formatted documents, including motions, pleadings, and more. However, you must review and validate all documents before submission. AI Law Solutions does not guarantee legal effectiveness or acceptance by any court or agency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is my data private?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely. All data you upload or input into Veritas is encrypted and securely stored. Only you (and your firm, if applicable) have access. We never sell, share, or analyze your files without permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Who can use Veritas?</h2>
      <p>Veritas is available to both individuals and law firms. B2B users may access additional features such as Team Mode, Evidence Upload, and Client File Integration, depending on their subscription tier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is Veritas always correct?</h2>
      <p>Veritas is highly accurate but not infallible. It learns continuously and improves with use, but human oversight is always required. You are responsible for confirming all legal outputs before use.</p>
    </div>
